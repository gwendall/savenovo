#Save Novo

On January 4th 2023, our friend CryptoNovo got scammed and lost most of his NFTs, including his iconic CryptoPunk #3706.

This initiative is dedicated to help Novo recover his lost punk, and act as a reminder to be safe out here. Unfortunately, scams still happen everyday. Today it is Novo, tomorrow it could be you.

The collection is made of 576 tokens, one for each pixel of punk #3706. Each token is worth 0.14 ETH, which will make 80 ETH if we mint it all (the price to get #3706 back). No royalties, 100% of the proceeds will be sent to a recovery wallet set for buying Novoâ€™s punk back (0xd7da0ae98f7a1da7c3318c32e78a1013c00df935).
